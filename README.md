## Using

### Finite Automata

```I'm so tired
I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired
My mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up
and fix myself a drink
No, no no...

But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
for a little peace of mind
```
